# ChocoBot

In Memoriam üç´

## Installation

Grab yourself either [Nix](https://nixos.org) and/or [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), then 

- open `settings.json.example` and change the token in it, save as `settings.json`
- if you have Nix, run `nix-shell`, if you have poetry, `poetry shell`
- in that shell, run `python -m chocobot` to start the bot
- to build an executable with nix, do `nix-build`, which will generate `result/bin/chocobot`.
